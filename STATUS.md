## Getting Started for Next Development Session

1. **Priority Tasks to Pick Up**
   - Implement password hashing in the authentication system
   - Create tweet persistence functionality
   - Start working on the user profile page

2. **Setup Steps**
   ```bash
   # 1. Install dependencies
   npm install

   # 2. Start development server
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Key Files to Focus On**
   - `/src/components/LandingPage.tsx` - For authentication improvements
   - `/src/components/Tweet.tsx` - For tweet functionality
   - `/src/data/users.json` - For data structure reference

4. **Current User Data Structure**
   ```typescript
   interface User {
     username: string;
     password: string;
     name?: string;
     email?: string;
     dateOfBirth?: {
       month: string;
       day: string;
       year: string;
     };
   }
   ```

## Notes
- The project uses Vite's dev server for handling API requests
- User data is currently stored in a JSON file (temporary solution)
- Authentication is basic and needs security improvements
- The UI closely matches the X (Twitter) design but needs more features

Remember to branch out from main before starting new feature development!
